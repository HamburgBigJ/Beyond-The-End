You awaken at the edge of a fractured world.  
Ruins whisper secrets of ancient magic, and strange machines hum beneath the surface.  
Your journey begins with nothing but your hands and your wits.  
As days pass, you craft, grow stronger, and glimpse the portals that lead far **beyond the End**.  
Will you conquer the arcane, tame the machine, or become one with nature?
